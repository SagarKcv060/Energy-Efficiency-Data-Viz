# Energy-Efficiency-Data-Viz

Tool Used: Pivot tables and Graphs, MY SQL
              In this Project, first the dataset is cleaned and prepared for the SQL analysis and Visualization done in adcance Excel. In todays construction world, a building with Energy Efficient is atmost importance. The main parameters that effects the energy absorption in a building are Building Orientation, Glazed area and their distribution, Height of building, Relative compactness and total surface area. These parameters relation with Heating load and Cooling load are analysed and data extracted through Queries in My SQL and same data visualized in Excel to show their relationship and effects.
